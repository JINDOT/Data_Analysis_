/*
Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. 
The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. 
If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically.
Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. 
If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.

# 별칭을 사용했다면 반드시 사용해주기.
# 조인 조건 1=1은 왠만하면 사용하지 않기. 값이 불안정하다.

# 아니 진짜 이거 프로그래머스에서는 기본 JOIN 문제 쉬운데.. 내가 이상한건가..
